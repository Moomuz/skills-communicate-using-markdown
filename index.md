# Headers
Headers indicate the start of a new section. There are 6 header sizes, each indicated by the number of hash symbols (#) used.

# This is an `<h1>` header
## This is an `<h2>` header
### This is an `<h3>` header
#### This is an `<h4>` header
##### This is an `<h5>` header
###### This is an `<h6>` header

# Images
You can also add images to markdown files by adding a hyperlink directly to the image. Short descriptions can also be added in between square brackets ([]) to either be read aloud for accessibility reasons or to be displayed when the connection is not strong enough to display the image.

# Code Blocks
Code blocks format the content in a differently-colored space with a monospaced font to make it easy to distinguish as code. When a specific programming language is indicated, keywords can become color-coded to increase readability.

```
String myString = "Hello world!";
```

# Task List
Tasks lists are checklists you can add to markdown files or pull requests. They are especially helpful in keeping track of issues in the code. The syntax is slightly different for completed and uncompleted tasks.

- [x] Item 1
- [ ] Item 2
- [ ] Item 3
